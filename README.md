# MachineLearning

This is a simple collection of Machine Learning tools built solely for practise. 
Most of the information and implementation is from "Machine Learning: An algorithmic perspective."

When this repo is done with, it should ideally have implementations of most of the exercises and problems in the book. The code used here is not necessarily correct, optimal or even compilable.
